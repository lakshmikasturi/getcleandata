This is a code book for the run_analysis.R program for performing cleaning and tidying analysis on raw data.
data1 - Main directory in which the raw data of UCI_HAR_data is stored.
UCI_HAR_data - The unzipped folder containing the raw data.
training.x - It contains the X_train.txt data.
training.y - It contains the y_train.txt data.
training.subject - It contains the subject_train.txt data.
test.x - It contains the X_test.txt data.
test.y - It contains the y_test.txt data.
test.subject - It contains the subject_test.txt data.
merge1.x - It contains merged X_train and X_test data.
merge1.y - It contains merged y_train and y_test data.
merge1.subject - It contains merged subject_train and subject_test data.
dataframe1 - The 3 raw datasets: merge1.x, merge1.y, merge1.subject are merged into a single dataframe.
features - It stores the features.txt file containing the names of the 561 features of a particular subject from merge1.subject.
            who is performing a particular activity from merge1.y.
mean.col - It stores the variable names containing the string "mean()".
std.col - It stores the variable names containing the string "std()".
edf - Dataframe containing the extracted mean and std values.
colnames(edf)[67] and [68] rename them as "activity.name" and "person.id" respectively.
Assign descriptive names to activities in the column activity.name of dataframe "edf".
1 <-"WALKING"
2 <-"WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
3 <-"WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS"
4 <-"SITTING"
5 <-"STANDING"
6 <-"LAYING"
Remove special characters "-" and "()" from the variable names using gsub and sub.
Convert all variable names to lowercase using tolower function.
tidy.datframe - It is the final, independent, tidyied dataframe containing the average of each variable for each activity performed by each subject.
UCI_HAR_tidy.txt - The tidy.dataframe is written to this text file.
